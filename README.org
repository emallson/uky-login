* UKY Login

This script allows command-line login to the University of Kentucky secure wifi
(which, for those not in the know, has a login page after connecting).

* Setting Up

  If you do not have a GPG key, please make one first. Login credentials should
  /never/ be stored in plain text!

  Once you have a GPG key, edit =~/.authinfo.gpg= and add a line like the
  following:

  #+begin_example
  machine wireless.net.uky.edu login <link blue account name> port 80 password "<your password>"
  #+end_example

  Save it (making sure that it does indeed get encrypted!). Install this
  package by cloning the repository and running ~npm install -g~ inside it.

  Now: =uky-login= will log you into the secure wifi!

* How it Works

  It reads the username/password for =wireless.net.uky.edu:80= from your
  GPG-encrypted =~/authinfo.gpg= file. This information is passed to a
  PhantomJS instance, which logs in with it.
